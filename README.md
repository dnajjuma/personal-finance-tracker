My personal finance tracker is built to help users manage their income and expenses efficiently, track spending patterns, and visualize their financial data. The app allows for categorization of transactions and a responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile.


 ** Core Features **
Transaction Management

 -Input forms for recording transactions (income and expenses).
- Fields include: Amount, Category, Date, and Notes.
- Categorization

Transactions are categorized into predefined categories (e.g., Food, Salary, Rent, etc.).
- Users can filter transactions by category.
- Data Visualization

Display income vs expenses data using charts (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs).
- Multiple viewing options: Monthly, Yearly, and Custom Date Range.
- Responsive Design

The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring smooth usability across mobile and desktop devices.

** Data Persistence **

Transaction data is stored locally using browser storage (LocalStorage or IndexedDB), allowing persistence even after closing the browser.

Technology Stack
Frontend Framework: React.js for building a scalable and type-safe UI.
Styling: CSS for a responsive, modern design.
Chart Library: Chart.js for dynamic and interactive data visualization.
Data Persistence: LocalStorage or IndexedDB to save transaction data persistently across sessions.
