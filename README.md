My personal finance tracker is built to help users manage their income and expenses efficiently, track spending patterns, and visualize their financial data. The app allows for categorization of transactions and a responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile.


 ** Core Features **

1. Transaction Management
- Input forms for recording transactions (income and expenses).
- Fields include: Amount, Category and Notes.

2. Categorization
- Transactions are categorized into predefined categories (e.g. Income, Expenses).

3. Data Visualization
- Display income vs expenses data using charts (e.g bar graphs).

4. Responsive Design
- The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring smooth usability across mobile and desktop devices.

5. Data Persistence 
- Transaction data is stored locally using browser storage (LocalStorage), allowing persistence even after closing the browser.
